## Status

This project is still in beta, and the UI is not yet final. I am currently working to convert the UI to Material You 3, which is a new design language from Google that uses dynamic colors based on the user's wallpaper. Stay tuned for updates!

FeedYOU is an open-source app that I built for my college project. I will continue to update it with new features.
